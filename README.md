Intrig streamlines the development process at its very core by programmatically generating boilerplate code for integrating a backend API, DB, or any other data sources into a JS/TS application through plugins. It's a productivity tool built for and by developers with the sole purpose of reducing redundancy.

It's effortless - just fire up the inbuilt command-line interface (CLI), and watch as a compatible native codebase emerges, designed to facilitate seamless integration with your chosen framework. Intrig accommodates a broad spectrum of popular frameworks: React developers will appreciate the generation of custom hooks, while Angular developers can benefit from a set of ready-to-use services.
